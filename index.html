    <p>We are a state in southwestern Nigeria; bounded to the east by Ekiti and Ondo states, to the north by Kwara State, to the south by Ogun State and to the west by Oyo State. Named for the River Osunâ€”a vital river which flows through the stateâ€”the state was formed from the southeast of Oyo State on 27 August 1991 and has its capital as the city of Osogbo. The name â€˜â€™Osunâ€™â€™ comes from a river that flows through the state. It is symbolic because it serves both spiritual and tourist purposes in the state. The river is worshipped annually by devotees. It is also a tourist spot as people from different parts of the country visit the Osun Groove in Osogbo. <br> The river also provides water for irrigation for the agriculturally rich state.</p>
