                <h2>The Church Of God</h2>
                <p>The church belongs to God. It is where you hear the truth. It is where God wants you to be. The church is the body of Christ. “And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all” (Ephesians 1:22-23). Jesus Christ is the head of the church. The general overseer or the earthly minister of a church is under the head of the church. We must all look up to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. We must strive to please Him. Many try to please their pastors, but do not please the real head of the church, which is Jesus.</p>

                <h2>What is the Church?</h2>  
                <p>The apostle Paul further clarifies who or what the Bible means by “church” in 1 Corinthians 14:23. He tells the Corinthians, “If the whole church comes together in one place. …” If the Church can “come together,” it certainly doesn’t sound like it is a building—but rather something else. <br> The Church is a group of people called out for a special purpose. They are “called”—that is called by God. Those truly part of God’s Church have been called by God to become part of His Church. They are called out of the world—the society around us—to become followers of Christ—to be Christians. They are called out to be followers of Christ and to live a new way of life. </p>
