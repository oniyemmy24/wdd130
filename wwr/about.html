            <p>The Kumano region has a deep history of over 2,000 years. The Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route was formed over 1,200 years ago. The route was a link between the three provinces of Kii, Saitama, and Wakayama. It was an important trading route during the Heian period as it served as a link between the three provinces. It wasnâ€™t until a full century later that whitewater rafting evolved into a recreational sport. In 1940, the Salmon River became one of the first to host guided rafting trips through its rapids. The popularity of the spot grew throughout World War II and began to spread to other rivers. In 1972, whitewater rafting became an official sport and made its first appearance at the Munich Olympics. Since then, whitewater rafting has thrived in rivers with great rapids and where communities embraced outdoor adventure.</p>

            <p> Today, the Deschutes River is one of the most popular rivers for whitewater rafting in the Northwest. People come from across the country to experience the many outdoor wonders of the Deschutes River Canyon and to challenge themselves with Class III and IV rapids. Imperial River Company in Maupin is a well-known destination for guided rafting trips, where they carry on the proud tradition of navigating thrilling rapids for young and old rafters alike.</p>
